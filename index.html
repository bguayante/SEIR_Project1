				Flash Cards is a game of memorization. Click through the cards to see
				each question. Press spacebar to see the answer. If your answer matches
				the one on the back of the card, click "I got it right!" and the card
				will be removed from the deck. The game is over when all cards have been
				removed and you have been crowned Tiger King!
